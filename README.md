| Repo Name | Description | Link |
|---|---|---|
| MCP_CAN Library for Arduino | MCP_CAN library v1.5 This library is compatible with any shield or board that uses the MCP2515 or MCP25625 CAN protocol controller. | https://github.com/MiiGoto/MCP_CAN_lib |
| nano-can | This repository has the arduino code for use with nano can PCB. These were created as a cheap device for people to get into car hacking. | https://github.com/mintynet/nano-can|
| ROOTCON 17 Car Hacking Village Synopsis | Code for ROOTCON's Car Hacking Village. | https://github.com/ROOTCONLabs/carhacking |
| opendbc | A DBC file encodes, in a humanly readable way, the information needed to understand a vehicle's CAN bus traffic. A vehicle might have multiple CAN buses and every CAN bus is represented by its own dbc file. | https://github.com/commaai/opendbc |
| can-utils | This repository contains some userspace utilities for Linux CAN subsystem (aka SocketCAN). | https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils |
| CarHackingTools | CarHacking.Tools is a scripts collection of scripts to help jump start car research (and hacking?). All the scripts are designed and update to run on Ubuntu 20.04. | https://github.com/jgamblin/CarHackingTools |
| UDS Server | Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) Server - is a ECU simulator that provides UDS support. This application was originally written to go alongside of [ICSim] (https://github.com/zombieCraig/ICSim) for training. | https://github.com/zombieCraig/uds-server |
| ICSim | Instrument Cluster Simulator for SocketCAN. | https://github.com/zombieCraig/ICSim |
| canTot | canTot is a python-based cli framework based on sploitkit and is easy to use because it is similar to working with Metasploit. This similar to an exploit framework but focused on known CAN Bus vulnerabilities or fun CAN Bus hacks. | https://github.com/shipcod3/canTot |
| Remote Exploitation of an Unaltered Passenger Vehicle | Car security research is interesting for a general audience because most people have cars and understand the inherent dangers of an attacker gaining control of their vehicle. | https://illmatics.com/Remote%20Car%20Hacking.pdf |
